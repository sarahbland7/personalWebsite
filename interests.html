<h3>Leadership & Service</h3>
<p>I am presently serving as a Resident Advisor in Hereford Residential College and love the opportunity it provides
to get to know the women who will be shaping the future and support them along that path, whatever that might look like.
I'm also grateful for the opportunity to lead Hereford towards a more sustainable future through spearheading a $900 GIFT
Grant funded Sustainability Initiative. Check out the organization at the following link:

<h3>Involvement</h3>

<p>My faith is very important to me and, as such, I'm blessed to say I've grown leaps and bounds through involvement in
first Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, then InterVarsity on Grounds. I'm so excited to be living in a Christian service
house devoted to repairing socioeconomic and racial stratifications in a local CVille neighborhood in the coming year.</p>

<p>I'm a huge fan of hackathons! I've been to three thus far: Hack.UVA, HackNC, and Pearl Hacks. I hope to attend at least
two more in the 2017 MLH season in order to hone some mobile development skills and play with hardware some more.</p>

<p>This is my second semester on the Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team @ the University of Virginia and it is SO MUCH FUN!
  I love the thrill of laying out to snag a disc and score a point (or, even better yet, on a D). Check out this around:</p>
