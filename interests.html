<h3>Leadership & Service</h3>

<p>ACM</p>

<p>John D. Perkins House... I'm so excited to be living in a Christian service
  house devoted to repairing socioeconomic and racial stratifications in a local
  CVille neighborhood in the coming year.
</p>

<p>I am presently serving as a Resident Advisor in Hereford Residential College and love the opportunity it provides
to get to know the women who will be shaping the future and support them along that path, whatever that might look like.
I'm also grateful for the opportunity to lead Hereford towards a more sustainable future through spearheading a $900 GIFT
Grant funded Sustainability Initiative. Check out the organization at the following link:

<h3>Involvement</h3>

<p>I'm a huge fan of hackathons! I've been to three thus far: Hack.UVA, HackNC, and Pearl Hacks. I hope to attend a
a couple in the 2018 MLH season (e.g. Hack.UVA again) but have also realized that fun projects don't need to be relegated
exclusively to super intense weekend sprints. Check out some of my favorite projects at the following links: </p>

<p>I spent 3 semesters on the Women's Ultimate Frisbee Team @ the University of Virginia
  and absolutely LOVED IT. Nothing beats the thrill of laying out to snag a disc and score
  a point (or, even better yet, assist on a D). Check out this around:</p>

<p>My faith is very important to me and, as such, I'm blessed to say I've grown leaps and bounds through involvement in
  first Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, then InterVarsity on Grounds.</p>
