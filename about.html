<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I am currently a second year (or "sophomore", for all you chill people) at the University of Virginia
and am double majoring Computer Science (B.A.) and Environmental Sciences (B.A.). There also may or
may not be a Spanish minor in the works.</p>

<!Create a smaller title w/ info>
<h3>Language Skills</h3>

<p>Currently, I am proficient in Java, C++, and Matlab programming languages. CS 3330, or Computer Architecture
(the primary CS class in which I'm enrolled atm), works with C, Intel x86 assembly, Y86 machine language, and HCL/ HCL2D
(UVa's variant).<p>

<p>To a lesser extent, I have experience with shell script programming, IBCM (UVa's very own machine language), and Mathematica.
I'm excited about HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript and coded this website from scratch using them but
definitely want to learn more.</p>

<p>Then there're the eight years of classroom experience with Spanish, if you're counting conventional languages.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<p>This semester is my first as a Teaching Assistant with UVa's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. My
responsibilites include attending lectures, proctoring labs, holding office hours, and assisting my professors in
grading exams for CS 2110 (Software Development Methods), which is taught in Java.</p>

<p>I spent this last summer working on Program Staff at Camp Greystone, a Christian camp for girls in NW North Carolina.
It was so much fun! I did a lot of canoeing and archery, which fit in perfectly with my love of nature.</p>
