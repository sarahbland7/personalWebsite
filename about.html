<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I am currently a third year (or "junior,"" for all you chill people) at the University of Virginia.
My academics are STEM oriented (double major in Computer Science and Environmental Sciences) with a
trajectory towards software development; I care deeply about public service in my personal life.</p>

<!Create a smaller title w/ info>
<h3>Language Skills</h3>

<p>Currently, I am proficient in Java, C++, and Matlab programming languages. CS 3330, or Computer Architecture
(the primary CS class in which I'm enrolled atm), works with C, Intel x86 assembly, Y86 machine language, and HCL/ HCL2D
(UVa's variant).<p>

<p>To a lesser extent, I have experience with shell script programming, IBCM (UVa's very own machine language), and
  Mathematica.I'm excited about HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript and coded this website from scratch using them but
  definitely want to learn more.</p>

<p>Then there're the eight years of classroom experience with Spanish, if you're counting conventional languages.</p>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<p>I've now spent 3 semesters as a TA for CS 2110 (Software Develpment Methods), 2 as Secondary Instructor for CS 2110,
  and 1 as a TA for CS 4102 (Algorithms). My responsibilites are pretty run-of-the-mill (i.e. attending lectures,
  proctoring labs, holding office hours, grading exams, leading a Java-based lab redesign team for 2110) but
  my enthusiasm is nothing-but. In particular, I'd TA 4102 for free! :P</p>

<!--
<p>I spent this last summer working on Program Staff at Camp Greystone, a Christian camp for girls in NW North Carolina.
It was so much fun! I did a lot of canoeing and archery, which fit in perfectly with my love of nature.</p>
